# DevPod Desktop (New)

Rewrite of the DevPod desktop app using **Tauri v2 + SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte**.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Shell | [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/) (Rust) |
| Frontend | [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) (SPA via `adapter-static`) |
| Components | [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/) (bits-ui + Tailwind v4) |
| State | Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) + stores |
| IPC | Tauri `invoke` commands with mock layer for browser dev |
| Terminal | xterm.js + Tauri PTY backend |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The desktop app shells out to the `devpod` CLI binary for all operations. Build it first or the app will fail at startup:

```bash
# From the repo root — build the CLI binary
go build -o devpod ./cmd/devpod

# Place it somewhere on your PATH
cp devpod /usr/local/bin/
# — or next to the Tauri binary (src-tauri/target/debug/)
```

The Rust backend resolves the binary in this order:
1. Same directory as the desktop executable
2. System `PATH`

### Development

```bash
cd desktop-new
npm install

# Browser-only dev (mock IPC, no Rust compilation)
npm run dev          # http://localhost:1420

# Full Tauri dev (requires Rust toolchain + devpod binary)
npm run desktop:dev

# Type-check
npm run check

# Tests
npm run test
```

## Architecture Notes

**IPC mock layer** — All Tauri commands go through `src/lib/ipc/commands.ts`, which delegates to either real Tauri `invoke` calls or mock implementations (in `src/lib/ipc/mock.ts`). This lets you develop the UI in a browser without compiling Rust. The `isTauri()` check detects the runtime.

**Stores** — Each domain (workspaces, providers, machines, contexts) has an `init*` / `destroy*` lifecycle called from the app layout's `onMount`/`onDestroy`. Stores poll the CLI for state and emit events.

**Daemon watcher** — The Rust backend watches `~/.devpod` for filesystem changes and polls the DevPod CLI for state. Changes are pushed to the frontend via Tauri events.

**Provider icons** — `ProviderIcon.svelte` maps provider names to SVG brand logos (AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes). Unknown providers get a generic fallback.

## Known Issues

**macOS WKWebView first-click bug** — SvelteKit's `goto()` and `<a href>` navigation silently fail on the first click in Tauri's WKWebView. Root cause is SSR hydration — the Tauri docs require `ssr = false` but this currently causes a black screen in dev mode. See `app.html` for full details and issue links.

## Adding a UI Component

```bash
npx shadcn-svelte@next add <component>
```

Components land in `src/lib/components/ui/`. They use bits-ui for headless behavior and Tailwind v4 for styling.
